# 📱 Unified Frontend Structure

## ✅ What Has Been Accomplished

### 1. **All Guard Features Copied to Main Frontend**
All the working pages from `/workforceone-separated/guard/` have been successfully copied to `/workforceone/frontend/app/dashboard/`:

- ✅ Guards List (`/dashboard/guards`)
- ✅ Guard Onboarding (`/dashboard/guards/onboard`)
- ✅ Incidents (`/dashboard/incidents`)
- ✅ Create Incident (`/dashboard/incidents/create`)
- ✅ Checkpoints (`/dashboard/checkpoints`)
- ✅ Sites (`/dashboard/sites`)
- ✅ Monitoring (`/dashboard/monitoring`)
- ✅ Operations (`/dashboard/operations`)
- ✅ Invitations (`/dashboard/invitations`)

### 2. **Unified Product Navigation Created**
- **Location**: `/components/navigation/UnifiedProductNavigation.tsx`
- Clear visual distinction between the 3 products:
  - 🛡️ **Guard Management** (Purple theme)
  - 🌍 **Remote Workforce** (Blue theme)
  - ⏰ **Time Tracking** (Green theme)
- All features organized under their respective products
- Visual badges for live/working features

### 3. **Unified Overview Dashboard**
- **Location**: `/app/dashboard/UnifiedOverview.tsx`
- Shows summary cards for all 3 products
- Real-time statistics from database
- Quick actions for each product
- Live activity feed
- System-wide actions

### 4. **Main Dashboard Updated**
- Automatically shows unified overview for users with multiple products
- Single product users redirect to their product dashboard
- Clean product selection for new users
