3. After signup, redirected to **Welcome Page**
4. Receive unique **6-character join code**
5. Share code with team members

### For Team Members Joining

2. Enter the 6-character code
3. System validates and shows organization name
4. Complete signup to join organization
5. Automatically assigned as "employee" role

### Join Methods Available

Pre-fills the code in signup form

#### Method 3: Individual Invitation

## 📊 Database Structure

### Organizations Table
```sql
- id: UUID
- name: String
- join_code: String (6 chars, unique)
- settings: JSONB
- feature_flags: JSONB
```

### Company Invitations Table
```sql
- id: UUID
- organization_id: UUID
- email: String
- role: String (admin/manager/employee)
- department: String (optional)
- invitation_token: String
- status: String (pending/accepted/cancelled)
- expires_at: Timestamp
```

### Profiles Table
```sql
- id: UUID (matches auth user)
- organization_id: UUID
- full_name: String
- email: String
- role: String
- department: String
- status: String (active/inactive)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Validation**: Validates codes as user types
2. **Secure Generation**: Cryptographically random codes
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing codes
4. **Role Assignment**: Auto-assigns roles based on join method
5. **Expiry Management**: Invitations expire after 7 days

### Code Generation Algorithm
```javascript
const generateJoinCode = () => {
  const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'
  let code = ''
  for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    code += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length))
  }
  return code
}
```
