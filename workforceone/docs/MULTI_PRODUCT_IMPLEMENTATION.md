# WorkforceOne Multi-Product Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

WorkforceOne has been successfully transformed from a monolithic application into three focused, purchasable products:

- **WorkforceOne Remote** ($8/user/month) - Team & task management for distributed workforces
- **WorkforceOne Time** ($6/user/month) - Time tracking & attendance for hourly workers  
- **WorkforceOne Guard** ($12/user/month) - Security patrol & incident management

The complete bundle is available at $20/user/month (23% savings), providing customers flexibility while maximizing revenue opportunities.

## üéØ Business Impact

### Customer Benefits
- **Simplified Pricing**: Pay only for needed features ($6-12 vs $15+ monolithic)
- **Reduced Complexity**: Product-specific UIs show only relevant features
- **Scalable Growth**: Add products as business needs evolve
- **Bundle Savings**: 23% discount for complete solution

### Business Benefits
- **Market Expansion**: Three distinct customer segments instead of one
- **Upsell Opportunities**: Natural progression from single to multi-product
- **Higher ARPU**: Bundle pricing increases average revenue per user
- **Competitive Advantage**: Flexible pricing vs fixed enterprise solutions

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Design

The modularization introduces a robust multi-product architecture:

#### Core Product Tables
```sql
-- Products definition
CREATE TABLE products (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    monthly_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    annual_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    features TEXT[],
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Organization subscriptions
CREATE TABLE organization_subscriptions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
    product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
    status subscription_status NOT NULL,
    billing_cycle billing_cycle NOT NULL,
    user_limit INTEGER,
    trial_end_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    subscription_start DATE,
    subscription_end DATE
);

-- User product access
CREATE TABLE user_product_access (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
    granted_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    granted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Product-Specific Table Mapping
- **Remote Product (29 tables)**: teams, tasks, projects, forms, routes, messages, workflows
- **Time Product (12 tables)**: attendance, time_entries, leave_requests, payroll, reminders  
- **Guard Product (22 tables)**: patrol_routes, checkpoints, incidents, guard_assignments

All existing tables now include `product_id` columns linking records to specific products.

### Access Control System

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
Every product table enforces access through RLS policies:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their product data" ON tasks
FOR ALL USING (
    has_product_access(auth.uid(), 'remote') AND
    get_user_organization(auth.uid()) = organization_id
);
```

#### Frontend Guards
```tsx
<RequireProduct products={['remote']}>
  <TeamsManagement />
</RequireProduct>

<RequireProduct products={['time', 'guard']} mode="any">
  <SharedFeature />
</RequireProduct>
```

#### React Hooks
```tsx
const { hasAccess, products } = useProductAccess();

if (hasAccess('remote')) {
  // Show remote-specific features
}
```

### Billing Integration

Complete Stripe integration with:
- Multi-product subscription management
- Bundle discount calculation (23% off for all three products)
- Prorated upgrades and downgrades
- Webhook handling for subscription changes
- Trial management with grace periods

```typescript
// Example billing service
class StripeService {
  async createSubscription(customerId: string, productIds: string[], billingCycle: 'monthly' | 'annual') {
    const isBundle = productIds.length === 3;
    const priceId = isBundle 
      ? this.getBundlePriceId(billingCycle)
      : this.getProductPriceIds(productIds, billingCycle);
    
    return await this.stripe.subscriptions.create({
      customer: customerId,
      items: [{ price: priceId }],
      trial_period_days: 14
    });
  }
}
```

### üß™ Quality Assurance

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
# Full product combination testing
node scripts/test-product-combinations.js

# Test scenarios include:
# - Single product access (Remote only, Time only, Guard only)
# - Two-product combinations (Remote+Time, Remote+Guard, Time+Guard)
# - Complete bundle access
# - No products access (should block everything)
# - Product switching workflows
```

- ‚úÖ Feature access for each product combination
- ‚úÖ Cross-product integrations where applicable
- ‚úÖ Product switching scenarios
- ‚úÖ Edge cases and error conditions

### üìà Migration Strategy

#### Existing Customer Transition
All existing customers are automatically grandfathered with:
- **Free access** to all three products during transition
- **Unlimited users** (999 user limit)
- **Extended trial** (999-year period, essentially permanent)
- **Preserved features** - All existing functionality maintained

#### Smart Data Migration
```bash
# Analyze usage patterns and recommend products
node scripts/migrate-existing-data.js --dry-run --verbose

# Execute migration with intelligent product assignment
node scripts/migrate-existing-data.js
```

The migration script analyzes:
- **Remote indicators**: Teams, tasks, forms, projects, routes
