# ðŸ”§ Fix SendGrid Sender Verification Issue

## The Problem
SendGrid requires the "FROM" email address to be verified before sending emails. Since you may not have access to `admin@workforceone.co.za`, we need to use a different approach.

## Quick Solution (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Use Your Personal Email (Recommended)
1. Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication**
3. Click **"Verify a Single Sender"**
4. Fill in with YOUR email:
   - **From Name**: WorkforceOne Alerts
   - **From Email**: YOUR-EMAIL@gmail.com (or any email you can access)
   - **Reply To**: YOUR-EMAIL@gmail.com
   - **Company**: Your company name
   - **Address**: Your address (can be generic)
5. Click **Create**
6. **Check YOUR email** for verification link
7. Click the verification link

### Option 2: Use a Test Email Service
If you want to test without using your personal email, you can use:
- **Temporary email**: https://temp-mail.org/
- Create a temporary email
- Use it for SendGrid sender verification
- Verify it quickly before it expires

## Update Environment Variables

After verifying YOUR email address, update `.env.local`:

```bash
# Update these with your verified email
FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@gmail.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-verified-email@gmail.com
```

## Test Commands

After updating and verifying:

```bash
# Restart the server to load new environment
npm run dev -- -p 3002

# Test email delivery
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/monitoring/incidents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "send_test_alert"}'
```

## Why This Works
- SendGrid will accept ANY verified email as sender
- The "TO" address (ADMIN_EMAIL) can be the same as FROM
- You'll receive incident alerts at your verified email
- Later you can add domain authentication for professional emails

## What Happens Next
Once verified, you'll receive:
- âœ… Test confirmation email
- ðŸš¨ Real incident alerts (3 critical issues detected)
- ðŸ¤– AI analysis and recommendations
- ðŸ“Š Rich HTML formatted reports

Your monitoring system is working perfectly - just needs sender verification! ðŸš€
