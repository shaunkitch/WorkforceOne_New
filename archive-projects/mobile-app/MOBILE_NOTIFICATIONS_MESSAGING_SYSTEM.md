# üì± Mobile App Notifications & Messaging System - COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed & Features Implemented

### üîß **Forms Assignment Issue - FIXED**

**Problem**: Forms were being assigned to all members automatically instead of only assigned members.

**Solution**: 
- ‚úÖ **Database Trigger**: Created `expand_form_assignments()` function that expands team/role/department assignments into individual user assignments
- ‚úÖ **Mobile App Filter**: Updated `FormsScreen.tsx` to only fetch assignments where `user_id` matches current user and excludes team/role/department assignments
- ‚úÖ **Proper Filtering**: Added `.is('assigned_to_team_id', null)`, `.is('assigned_to_role', null)`, `.is('assigned_to_department', null)` filters

**Result**: Users now only see forms that are specifically assigned to them individually.

## üéØ How It All Works

### **Form Assignment Flow**:
1. Admin assigns form to team/role/department in web interface
2. Database trigger `expand_form_assignments()` creates individual assignments
3. `notify_form_assignment()` trigger sends notifications to each user
4. Mobile app receives real-time notification
5. User sees notification in NotificationCenterScreen
6. User navigates to FormsScreen and sees only their assigned forms

### **Notification Flow**:
1. System event occurs (form assignment, task, etc.)
2. Notification inserted into `notifications` table
3. Real-time subscription triggers in mobile app
4. `NotificationService` handles notification display
5. User receives push notification (if app in background)
6. User can manage notifications in NotificationCenterScreen

### **Messaging Flow**:
1. User opens MessagesScreen
2. Selects recipient from organization members
3. Composes and sends message
4. Message stored in `in_app_messages` table
5. Recipient receives real-time notification
6. Recipient can reply directly from message interface

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Required

### **1. Database Migration**:
```sql
-- Run this migration to set up the notification system
-- File: 055_mobile_notifications_system.sql
```

### **2. Mobile App Setup**:
```bash
# Install required packages (if not already installed)
npm install expo-notifications expo-device expo-constants
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

### **3. Push Notification Setup**:
1. Configure Expo project for push notifications
2. Add projectId to app.json/app.config.js
3. Set up notification credentials in Expo dashboard
