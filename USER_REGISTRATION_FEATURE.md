# User Registration Feature - Teams Page

## Overview
Added comprehensive user registration functionality to the Teams page, allowing team leads and managers to invite new users to the WorkforceOne system.

## Features Added

### 1. User Registration Form
- **Email Address** (required): Primary identifier for new users
- **Full Name** (required): Display name for the user
- **Phone Number** (optional): Contact information
- **Department**: Categorization for organizational structure
- **Default Role**: Initial permission level (Member/Lead/Manager)
- **Add to Current Team** (checkbox): Option to immediately add user to selected team

### 2. Registration Process
- **Duplicate Check**: Validates that email doesn't already exist in system
- **Organization Assignment**: Automatically assigns user to current organization
- **Invitation Instructions**: Generates detailed signup instructions with pre-filled details
- **Team Assignment Notes**: Provides instructions for adding to teams after signup
- **Manual Invite Flow**: User-friendly approach that works without admin privileges

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Dual Access**: Register User buttons in both main header and team-specific header
- **Visual Distinction**: Blue-themed buttons to differentiate from other actions
- **Responsive Modal**: Scrollable form that works on all screen sizes
- **Informational Notes**: Clear explanation of invitation process
- **Form Validation**: Required field indicators and email validation

## Technical Implementation

### New State Management
```typescript
const [showRegisterUser, setShowRegisterUser] = useState(false)
const [registerForm, setRegisterForm] = useState({
  email: '',
  fullName: '',
  role: 'member' as 'member' | 'lead' | 'manager',
  department: '',
  phone: '',
  addToTeam: false
})
```

### Registration Function Features

- Duplicate email prevention
- Detailed invitation instructions generation
- Optional team assignment reminders
- Form reset and UI updates
- Error handling with user feedback

### Database Integration

- **Organization Context**: Ensures proper organizational boundaries
- **Invitation Logging**: Records invitation details (console/future table)
- **Team Reference**: Includes team assignment instructions

## User Interface

### Button Locations
1. **Main Header**: Global "Register User" button next to "Create Team"
2. **Team Header**: Team-specific "Register User" button next to "Add Member"

### Modal Features
