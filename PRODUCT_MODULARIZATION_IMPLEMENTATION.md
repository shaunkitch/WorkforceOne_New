# WorkforceOne Product Modularization - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a complete implementation guide for the WorkforceOne product modularization system, which transforms the monolithic application into three distinct, purchasable products:

- **WorkforceOne Remote** ($8/user/month) - Team & task management
- **WorkforceOne Time** ($6/user/month) - Time tracking & attendance  
- **WorkforceOne Guard** ($12/user/month) - Security patrol management

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Database Design

The modularization introduces several key database components:

#### Core Tables
- `products` - Defines the three product offerings
- `organization_subscriptions` - Tracks which products each organization subscribes to
- `user_product_access` - Grants individual users access to specific products

#### Enhanced Existing Tables
- All existing tables now have `product_id` columns linking them to specific products
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce product-based access control

### Product Mapping

```
📦 REMOTE PRODUCT (29 tables)
├── Core Features: teams, tasks, projects, forms, routes
├── Communication: messages, invitations, notifications
├── Workflows: templates, instances, steps, conditions
└── Outlets: shared locations for business operations

📦 TIME PRODUCT (12 tables)  
├── Time Tracking: attendance, time_entries, reminders
├── Leave Management: requests, balances, approvals
├── Payroll: payslips, tier_pricing
└── Email Integration: templates, logs

📦 GUARD PRODUCT (22 tables)
├── Patrol Management: routes, checkpoints, sessions
├── Incident Reporting: incidents, attachments, witnesses  
├── Guard Operations: assignments, invitations
└── System Monitoring: metrics, alerts, health checks
```

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. Database Migrations (076-079)
- **076_create_product_system.sql** - Foundation product tables and data

### 📋 Pricing Structure

| Product | Monthly | Annual (20% off) | Features |
|---------|---------|------------------|----------|
| Remote | $8/user | $76.80/user | Teams, Tasks, Projects, Forms, Routes |
| Time | $6/user | $57.60/user | Attendance, Leave, Payroll, Time Tracking |
| Guard | $12/user | $115.20/user | Patrols, Incidents, Checkpoints, Monitoring |
| **Bundle** | **$20/user** | **$192/user** | **All products (23% discount)** |

### 🔐 Access Control System

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
Every product-specific table has RLS policies that check:
```sql
has_product_access(auth.uid(), 'product_code') 
AND get_user_organization(auth.uid()) = organization_id
```

#### Frontend Guards
```tsx
<RequireProduct products={['remote']}>
  <TeamsManagement />
</RequireProduct>

<RequireProduct products={['time', 'guard']} mode="any">
  <SharedFeature />
</RequireProduct>
```

#### React Hooks
```tsx
const { hasAccess, products } = useProductAccess();

if (hasAccess('remote')) {
  // Show remote features
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Automated Test Suite

Run comprehensive product combination tests:

```bash
# Full test suite
node scripts/test-product-combinations.js

# Quick test (subset of tests)  
node scripts/test-product-combinations.js --quick

# Verbose output
node scripts/test-product-combinations.js --verbose
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- ✅ RLS policies for all product tables
- ✅ Feature access for each product combination  
- ✅ Cross-product integrations
- ✅ Product switching scenarios
- ✅ Edge cases (no products, shared resources)

### User Scenarios Tested

1. **Single Product Users** - Remote only, Time only, Guard only
2. **Two Product Combinations** - Remote+Time, Remote+Guard, Time+Guard  
3. **All Products User** - Complete bundle access
4. **No Products User** - Should be blocked from everything
5. **Product Switching** - Sequential access to different product features

## 📊 Migration Process

### 1. Existing Customer Migration

All existing customers are automatically "grandfathered" with:
- Free access to all three products during transition
- Unlimited users (999 user limit)
- 999-year trial period (essentially permanent)
- Original feature flags preserved in metadata

### 2. Data Migration

The migration script analyzes existing usage patterns:

```bash
# Dry run to see what would happen
node scripts/migrate-existing-data.js --dry-run --verbose

# Execute migration  
node scripts/migrate-existing-data.js
```

### Migration Intelligence

The script analyzes organization usage to recommend products:
- **Remote indicators**: Teams, tasks, forms, projects, routes
- **Time indicators**: Attendance records, leave requests, timesheets  
- **Guard indicators**: Patrol routes, incidents, checkpoints

### 3. Validation Steps

After migration:
1. Run `test-product-combinations.js` to verify access controls
2. Check for orphaned records without `product_id`
3. Validate billing integration with test subscriptions
4. Monitor for access issues in production

## 🎯 Business Benefits

### For Customers
- **Simplified Pricing** - Pay only for needed features ($6-12 vs $15+ monolithic)
- **Reduced Complexity** - See only relevant features in UI
- **Scalable Growth** - Add products as business needs evolve

**Q: Billing webhook failing**  
A: Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe dashboard settings

**Q: Migration script fails**
A: Run with `--dry-run` first, check database permissions and table existence

**Q: Test suite shows failures**
A: Review RLS policies, ensure all required tables exist with proper columns

### Debug Commands

```sql
-- Check user's product access
SELECT * FROM user_product_access WHERE user_id = 'user-id';

-- Verify organization subscriptions  
SELECT * FROM organization_subscriptions WHERE organization_id = 'org-id';

-- Test RLS policy
SELECT has_product_access('user-id', 'remote');
```
