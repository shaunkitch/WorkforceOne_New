    tasks: true,
    projects: true,
    forms: true,
    announcements: true,
    analytics: true
  },

```

### Access Control
```typescript
// Middleware to check product access
export async function checkProductAccess(
  userId: string, 
  productCode: string
): Promise<boolean> {
  const access = await supabase
    .from('user_product_access')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .eq('product_code', productCode)
    .single();
    
  return !!access.data;
}

// Component wrapper
export function RequireProduct({ 
  product, 
  children 
}: { 
  product: string, 
  children: React.ReactNode 
}) {
  const hasAccess = useProductAccess(product);
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return <UpgradePrompt product={product} />;
  }
  
  return children;
}
```

### Database Migrations
```sql
-- Add product_id to all feature tables
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id) DEFAULT 'remote-product-id';
ALTER TABLE time_entries ADD COLUMN product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id) DEFAULT 'time-product-id';
ALTER TABLE patrol_sessions ADD COLUMN product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id) DEFAULT 'guard-product-id';

-- Create RLS policies per product
CREATE POLICY "users_access_based_on_product_subscription" ON tasks
FOR ALL USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_product_access upa
    WHERE upa.user_id = auth.uid()
    AND upa.product_id = tasks.product_id
