# AI-Powered Form Scanner Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an AI-powered form scanner feature that uses Claude's vision API to analyze uploaded images of paper forms and automatically generates digital form structures. The feature includes image upload, AI analysis, field detection, type mapping, and form generation capabilities.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **Scan Route Page**: `/app/dashboard/forms/scan/page.tsx`
   - Multi-step workflow (Upload → Analysis → Review → Save)
   - Image upload with drag-and-drop support
   - Real-time preview and validation
   - Interactive field editing interface
   - Progress tracking and error handling

2. **API Route**: `/app/api/forms/scan/route.ts`
   - Next.js API route for handling form uploads
   - Proxies requests to backend service
   - File validation and error handling

### Backend Services

1. **Claude Analysis Service**: `/src/services/claudeFormAnalysis.ts`
   - Integrates with Anthropic's Claude vision API
   - Optimized prompts for form structure analysis
   - Field detection and type classification
   - Confidence scoring and layout analysis

2. **Form Scan API Route**: `/src/routes/formScan.ts`
   - Express route handling file uploads
   - Multer configuration for image processing
   - Claude service integration
   - Health check and info endpoints

## Features

### Image Processing
- **Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- **File Size Limit**: 10MB maximum
- **Validation**: File type and size checking
- **Preview**: Real-time image preview with upload status

### AI Form Analysis
- **Field Detection**: Automatically identifies form fields
- **Type Classification**: Maps detected elements to supported field types
- **Label Extraction**: Extracts field labels and descriptions
- **Layout Analysis**: Determines form structure (single/multi-column, grid, complex)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides accuracy metrics for detected elements

### Supported Field Types

The scanner can detect and convert the following field types:

| Detected Type | Maps To | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `text_field` | `text` | Single line text input |
| `textarea` | `textarea` | Multi-line text input |
| `email_field` | `email` | Email input with validation |
| `number_field` | `number` | Numeric input |
| `dropdown` | `select` | Single selection dropdown |
| `radio_button` | `radio` | Radio button group |
| `checkbox` | `checkbox` | Checkbox group |
| `signature_field` | `signature` | Signature capture |
| `file_upload` | `file` | File upload field |
| `rating` | `rating` | Star rating |
| `scale` | `likert` | Likert scale |

### Interactive Editing
- **Field Selection**: Click to select and edit detected fields
- **Type Modification**: Change field types via dropdown
- **Label Editing**: Modify field labels and properties
- **Option Management**: Add/remove options for selection fields
- **Required Field Toggle**: Mark fields as required/optional
- **Field Addition**: Manually add fields not detected by AI

### Form Generation
