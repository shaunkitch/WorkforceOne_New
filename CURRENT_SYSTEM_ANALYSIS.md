## üîê Current RLS Policies Analysis

### Tables Needing Product-Based RLS:
1. **tasks** - Restrict to Remote subscribers
2. **attendance** - Restrict to Time subscribers
3. **patrol_routes** - Restrict to Guard subscribers
4. **forms** - Restrict to Remote subscribers
5. **leave_requests** - Restrict to Time subscribers
6. **security_incidents** - Restrict to Guard subscribers

### New RLS Pattern Needed:
```sql
-- Example for tasks table
CREATE POLICY "tasks_remote_product_access" ON tasks
FOR ALL USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_product_access upa
    JOIN products p ON p.id = upa.product_id
    WHERE upa.user_id = auth.uid()
    AND p.code = 'remote'
    AND upa.is_active = true
  )
);
```

## üéØ Features Not Yet Mapped

### Potentially Ambiguous Features:
1. **Outlets Management** - Remote or shared?
2. **Analytics/Reports** - Product-specific or combined?
3. **Automation Rules** - Which product?
4. **Integrations** - Product-specific?
5. **API Access** - Per product or global?

### Missing/Planned Features:
1. **Payroll Integration** - Time product
2. **Client Portal** - Guard product
3. **Equipment Management** - Guard product
4. **Training Records** - All products?
5. **Document Management** - Remote product

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Considerations

### Data Dependencies:
1. **Tasks ‚Üí Projects** - Both in Remote
2. **Attendance ‚Üí Leave** - Both in Time
3. **Incidents ‚Üí Patrols** - Both in Guard
4. **Teams ‚Üí Tasks** - Remote internal dependency
5. **Profiles ‚Üí Everything** - Core dependency

### Cross-Product Interactions:
1. **Notifications** - Shared but filtered by product
2. **Reports** - May combine data from multiple products
3. **Dashboard** - Shows widgets from all active products
4. **Mobile App** - Single app, multiple product modules
5. **API** - Needs product-aware endpoints

### Migration Challenges:
1. **Feature Flags** - Convert from feature-based to product-based
2. **User Permissions** - Add product layer to existing roles
3. **Existing Data** - Assign to appropriate products
4. **Billing** - Transition from single to multi-product
5. **Mobile App** - Update to support product switching

## üîÑ Data Flow Changes Required

### Current Flow:
```
User ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Data
```

### New Flow:
```
User ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Data
```

### Impact Areas:
1. Authentication flow (product selection)
2. Navigation generation (product-based)
3. API middleware (product validation)
4. Mobile app initialization (product detection)
5. Billing calculations (per-product usage)

This analysis reveals the full scope of the modularization project. Every component listed needs to be evaluated and potentially modified for the multi-product architecture.
